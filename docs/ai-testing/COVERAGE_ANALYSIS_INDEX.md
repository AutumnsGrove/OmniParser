## Why Coverage is Low

### Root Cause
All 39 integration tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.skip` because they require:
1. Active Anthropic API keys
2. External calls to Claude API
3. Network connectivity
4. Valid credentials to OpenAI/Anthropic services

### Result
- 0 integration tests actually executed
- No unit tests with mocked responses
- No test fixtures for common scenarios
- Core vision features completely untested

---

## Solution Approach

### Phase 1: Mocked Unit Tests (2-3 days)
Create unit tests that mock the API responses without requiring external services.

**Expected Result:** 32% → 50% coverage

**Steps:**
1. Create `tests/unit/test_ai_image_analyzer_mock.py`
2. Mock Claude API responses
3. Test basic analysis workflow
4. Test error scenarios
5. Add quality assessment mocks

**Example:**
```python
from unittest.mock import patch
import pytest

def test_image_analyzer_basic():
    """Test basic image analysis with mocked API."""
    analyzer = ImageAnalyzer()
    
    with patch('omniparser.ai_client.analyze') as mock_analyze:
        mock_analyze.return_value = {
            "description": "test image description",
            "features": ["feature1", "feature2"]
        }
        result = analyzer.analyze("test.jpg")
        assert result.description == "test image description"

def test_image_analyzer_error():
    """Test error handling."""
    analyzer = ImageAnalyzer()
    
    with patch('omniparser.ai_client.analyze') as mock_analyze:
        mock_analyze.side_effect = ValueError("Invalid image")
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            analyzer.analyze("bad.jpg")
```

### Phase 2: Error Handling Tests (3-5 days)
Test all error paths and edge cases.

**Expected Result:** 50% → 65% coverage

**Coverage Areas:**
- Missing files
- Invalid formats
- API timeouts
- Malformed responses
- Configuration errors

### Phase 3: Integration Test Activation (1-2 weeks)
Enable actual integration tests when API keys are available.

**Expected Result:** 65% → 80%+ coverage

## Summary

This coverage analysis identifies **critical gaps in AI module testing** (32% overall coverage). The root cause is that all integration tests are skipped because they require active API keys.

**The solution** is to implement unit tests with mocked API responses, which would:
1. Immediately improve coverage to 50%+
2. Validate error handling
3. Create reusable test fixtures
4. Provide confidence for production deployment

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days for Phase 1 (mocked tests)
**Expected result:** 32% → 50%+ coverage
**Long-term goal:** 80%+ coverage with all features validated

Start by reading COVERAGE_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt and reviewing the htmlcov/index.html report to identify your starting point.
