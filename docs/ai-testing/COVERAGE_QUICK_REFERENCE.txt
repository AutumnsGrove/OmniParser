CRITICAL GAPS:
• Image analysis pipeline - 105 lines untested
• Description generation - 70 lines untested  
• Quality metrics - 77 lines untested
• Error handling - 88 lines untested
• Advanced features - 180+ lines untested

REASON: Integration tests skipped (require active API keys)

SOLUTION: Implement unit tests with mocked API responses
Expected improvement: 32% -> 65%+ coverage in 1 week

FILES GENERATED:
✓ htmlcov/index.html (interactive coverage report)
✓ COVERAGE_REPORT_AI_MODULES.md (detailed analysis)
✓ AI_COVERAGE_SUMMARY.txt (executive summary)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review AI_COVERAGE_SUMMARY.txt for action items
2. Open htmlcov/index.html to identify specific lines
3. Create mock tests for critical modules
4. Target 70%+ coverage within 2 weeks
