## Why Coverage is Low

### Root Causes
1. **Integration Tests Skipped:** 39 tests marked with `@pytest.mark.skip` or `@pytest.mark.integration`
2. **Requires Active API Keys:** Tests need valid Anthropic API keys
3. **External Service Dependency:** Tests require calls to Claude API
4. **No Unit Tests:** No mocked tests for AI modules
5. **No Fixtures:** No pre-recorded API responses for testing

### Test Status
```
Total Integration Tests: 120
Selected (marked integration): 39
Actually Run: 0 (ALL SKIPPED)
Skipped: 39
Deselected: 81
```

**Result:** 0% of integration tests actually executed, explaining why code coverage is low.

## HTML Report Navigation

The detailed HTML coverage report is available at: `htmlcov/index.html`

### What to Look For in HTML Report:
1. **Index page** - Overall coverage statistics
2. **Module pages** - Line-by-line coverage for each file
3. **Missing lines** - Highlighted in red for uncovered code
4. **Covered lines** - Highlighted in green for tested code
5. **Partial lines** - Highlighted in yellow for conditionally covered code

### How to Use:
1. Open `htmlcov/index.html` in a web browser
2. Click on module names to see line-by-line coverage
3. Uncovered lines appear in red - these are testing targets
4. Hover over line numbers for coverage details

---

## Conclusion

The AI modules have **critical coverage gaps** (32% overall), with particularly concerning gaps in:
- **Image analysis/description** (16-19% coverage) - Core vision features
- **Quality assessment** (11% coverage) - Validation completely untested
- **Advanced configuration** (37% of config untested) - Production features

The low coverage is due to integration tests being skipped, requiring active API keys. The solution is to implement unit tests with mocked API responses, which would immediately improve coverage while also validating error handling and edge cases.

**Recommended Action:** Start with AI Image Analyzer and Quality modules (highest risk), using mocked responses to achieve >80% coverage within 1-2 weeks.
