## ‚öñÔ∏è Copyright Status

**All test fixtures in this directory are in the public domain or licensed for testing.**

### Public Domain Works

The majority of files are sourced from **Project Gutenberg**, which provides books whose copyrights have expired in the United States. These works are:

- Published before 1928 (and thus in the US public domain)
- Free to use, modify, and distribute without restrictions
- Not subject to copyright protection in the United States

### Licensed Test Files

Some markdown test files are sourced from GitHub repositories specifically created for testing purposes and are licensed under permissive licenses (MIT, CC-BY-SA, etc.).

- [fullpipe/markdown-test-page](https://github.com/fullpipe/markdown-test-page) - Markdown elements demonstration

**Purpose**: These repositories provide test files specifically designed for testing markdown parsers and renderers.

### Derived Works

**DOCX and additional MD files**: Created by converting Project Gutenberg TXT files to other formats. Since the source material is public domain, these conversions are also public domain.

### Additional Sources
**PDF Test Files**: Pulled from available papers/technical reports listed on the Nasa Archive ntrs.nasa.gov/
**Image Test Files**: Pulled from pixnio.com
**Starting .docx exxample files**: https://sample-files.com/documents/docx/

## üÜò Questions?

### How do I know these are really public domain?

All Project Gutenberg books included here were published before 1928, which means their copyrights have expired under US law. Additionally, Project Gutenberg only distributes works that are public domain in the US.

### Can I use these commercially?

Yes! Public domain means no restrictions on use, including commercial use.

### Do I need to include this README in my project?

No, but it's good practice to document your test data sources. You can copy relevant sections or create your own documentation.

### What if I need more test files?

Visit Project Gutenberg directly to download more public domain books, or create your own test fixtures using their materials as a base.

### Can I contribute additional test fixtures?

If you're contributing to this repository, please ensure any new test fixtures are also public domain or properly licensed. Document the source clearly in this README.

## üìú License

The test fixtures themselves are **public domain** or licensed for testing purposes.
