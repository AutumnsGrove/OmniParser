  - Available in `ClaudeUsage/pre_commit_hooks/` if needed later
  - Can be installed manually: `cp ClaudeUsage/pre_commit_hooks/* .git/hooks/`

- ❌ **README.md replacement** - Existing README is excellent
  - Current README is comprehensive (17,541 lines)
  - Already includes project status, installation, usage, and roadmap
  - No need to replace with BaseProject template

- ❌ **House Agents installation** - Optional enhancement
  - Installation instructions provided in TODOS.md
  - Can be installed when needed: `git clone https://github.com/houseworthe/house-agents.git /tmp/house-agents && cp -r /tmp/house-agents/.claude .`

---

## Analysis & Recommendations

### Commit Style Analysis

**Status:** ✅ Excellent (95% compliant)

Analyzed 20 recent commits:
- **19/20 commits** follow conventional commit format (feat:, docs:, fix:, test:, chore:)
- **1/20 commits** missing type prefix: "Change completion date for Phase 2.2"

**Examples of Good Commits:**
```
feat: Add persistent image extraction with Obsidian-compatible markdown output
fix: Correct hatchling build config for src layout
docs: Update documentation to reflect v0.1.0 status and Phase 2.3 completion
test: Add 5 Project Gutenberg EPUBs for integration testing
chore: Reorganize repository structure by moving documentation to docs/
```

**Recommendation:** Continue current excellent commit practices. Consider using commit message template from `ClaudeUsage/git_commit_guide.md` for 100% consistency.

---

### Branch Workflow Analysis

**Current State:** Single branch (main)

**Branches Found:**
- `main` (local and remote)
- No development branches detected

**Recommendation:**
- For current development phase (v0.1.0 in active development), single branch is appropriate
- Consider adopting `dev/main` branch strategy when approaching v1.0 or preparing for production releases
- See `ClaudeUsage/git_workflow.md` for branch strategy patterns
- CLAUDE.md already includes guidance on when to consider branch strategies

---

### Architecture Alignment

**Findings:**
- ✅ OmniParser already follows many BaseProject best practices
- ✅ Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (130,000+ words across planning docs)
- ✅ Test-driven development (357 tests)
- ✅ Type safety (mypy strict mode)
- ✅ Modern tooling (UV, Black, pytest)

**Assessment:** OmniParser is a model project that already embodies BaseProject principles. The integration primarily adds supplemental guides and optional enhancements.

---

### Tech Stack Compatibility

**Detected Stack:**
- Language: Python 3.10+
- Package Manager: UV ✅ (BaseProject recommended)
- Build System: Hatchling ✅ (Modern Python build backend)
- Formatter: Black ✅ (BaseProject standard)
- Type Checker: mypy ✅ (BaseProject recommended)
- Test Framework: pytest ✅ (BaseProject standard)

**Assessment:** 100% alignment with BaseProject recommendations. No changes needed.

---

## Backup Information

**Backup Directory:** `.baseproject-backup-20251023-173143/`

**Files Backed Up:**
- `CLAUDE.md` (original version before merge)
- `.gitignore` (original version before enhancements)
