## What Was Added

### New Files
| File/Directory | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `AgentUsage/` | 24 workflow guides (secrets, git, testing, docker, etc.) |
| `AgentUsage/pre_commit_hooks/` | Pre-commit hook scripts for Python |
| `TODOS.md` | Project task tracking file |

### Git Hooks Installed

- `pre-commit-secrets` - Scans for accidentally committed secrets
- `pre-push` - Pre-push validations

---

## What Was Modified

### CLAUDE.md
- Updated all references from `ClaudeUsage/` to `AgentUsage/`
- Updated marker comments to match new directory name
- Preserved all existing project-specific content

---

## What Was Skipped

### .gitignore
- **Reason:** Already contained all BaseProject entries (secrets.json, *.log, __pycache__/, .DS_Store, .claude/)

### House Agents Installation
- **Reason:** Remote session - agents won't persist
- **Note:** Can be installed later by cloning https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/house-agents.git to ~/.claude/agents/

### Commit Pattern Changes
- **Reason:** Already using conventional commits correctly (95% compliance)
- **Note:** One historical commit needs attention: "Added testing fixtures for recipe parsing"
